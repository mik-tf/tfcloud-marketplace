# Development Steps

This document outlines the modular and evolutive roadmap for the **tfcloud-platform** project.

## 1. Interface & Flow Integration

- Design and implement the core UI/UX interface.
- Integrate the end-to-end workflow for a mock deployment:
  - User authentication (mocked).
  - Project creation and management flows.
  - Display status and logs.
- Ensure components are modular to allow easy extension.

## 2. Connect to TFChain

- Integrate TFChain SDK for real deployments.
- Implement wallet management:
  - Generate/import keys.
  - Query balances and account info.
- Issue deployment transactions on TFChain.
- Handle transaction confirmation and errors.

## 3. Stripe Integration

- Set up Stripe SDK for fiat payments.
- Implement payment flow:
  - Create payment intents.
  - Securely collect payment details.
  - Handle webhooks for payment success/failure.
- Link payments to TFChain deployment credits.

## 4. Architecture Breakdown

### Frontend

- Framework: React/Vue (TBD).
- Component library setup.
- Routing and state management.
- API client abstraction.

### Backend

- Framework: Node.js/Express (TBD).
- RESTful API endpoints:
  - Auth, projects, deployments, payments.
- Database schema design (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- Integration adapters:
  - TFChain service.
