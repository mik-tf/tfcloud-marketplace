# ThreeFold Cloud Marketplace Backend Implementation

## Phase 1 Implementation Summary

We have implemented the first phase of the ThreeFold Cloud Marketplace backend using a serverless architecture with the following components:

### Completed Components

1. **Project Structure**
   - Set up the Netlify Functions-based backend structure
   - Configured TypeScript for type safety
   - Created necessary configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, netlify.toml)

2. **Authentication (Auth0)**
   - Implemented user registration and login flows
   - Set up role-based access control for cloud users, providers, and operators
   - Created JWT validation middleware for secure API access
   - Implemented profile management endpoints

3. **Database (FaunaDB)**
   - Designed collection structure for users, deployments, provider requests, etc.
   - Created indexes for efficient querying
   - Implemented a setup script for initializing the database
   - Created a service layer for database operations

4. **API Endpoints (Netlify Functions)**
   - Implemented authentication endpoints
   - Created cloud user endpoints for managing deployments
   - Set up cloud provider endpoints for node management
   - Implemented cloud operator endpoints for dashboard management
   - Created payment processing endpoints

5. **Payment Processing (Stripe)**
   - Implemented payment intent creation
   - Set up webhook handling for payment events
   - Created endpoints for managing payment methods
   - Implemented transaction history endpoints

6. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive README with setup instructions
   - Documented API endpoints
   - Added a simple API documentation page

### Next Steps

To complete Phase 1 implementation, the following tasks should be addressed:

1. **Testing**
   - Set up unit tests for controllers and services
   - Implement integration tests for API endpoints
   - Create end-to-end tests for user flows

2. **Frontend Integration**
   - Implement Auth0 authentication flow in the frontend
   - Create protected routes for different roles
   - Develop API client services for the frontend
   - Integrate Stripe Elements for payment forms

3. **Deployment**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
   - Configure Netlify deployment settings
   - Set up environment variables in Netlify

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add additional validation for input data
   - Set up logging and monitoring
   - Conduct security review

5. **Feature Completion**
   - Complete the "TODO" items in the codebase
   - Implement missing functionality in the FaunaDB service
   - Add error handling for edge cases
   - Implement pagination for list endpoints

## Phase 2 Planning

After completing Phase 1, we will move on to Phase 2, which will focus on ThreeFold-specific integrations:

1. **TF Connect Integration**
   - USDCâ†’TFT swap functionality
   - Wallet balance monitoring
   - Auto-top up configuration

2. **TFChain & Grid Deployment**
   - TFChain wallet connection
   - Deployment of workloads to TFGrid nodes
   - Resource monitoring and scaling

3. **Cloud Provider Alliance System**
   - Alliance formation workflow
   - Node contribution management
   - Revenue sharing implementation

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Staking discount tier implementation
   - Backup VM and QSFS configuration
   - Advanced node selection criteria
