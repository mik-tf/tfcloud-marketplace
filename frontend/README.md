# ThreeFold Cloud Marketplace Frontend

This is the frontend for the ThreeFold Cloud Marketplace, designed to work with the serverless backend implemented with Netlify Functions, Auth0, MongoDB Atlas, and Stripe.

> **Note**: This frontend is currently in early development. The UI components and basic structure have been implemented, but the integration with backend services and third-party providers (Auth0, Stripe, etc.) is still in progress.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Auth0 (planned)
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe Elements (planned)
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Backend API running (see [backend README](../backend/README.md))

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tfcloud-marketplace.git
cd tfcloud-marketplace/frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with the following variables:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8888/api
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain.auth0.com
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-auth0-client-id
VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://your-api-identifier
```

> **Note**: These environment variables are set up in anticipation of future development phases when the frontend will be integrated with the backend and third-party services. They are not currently being used by the code.

## Development

### Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Current Development Status

The frontend is currently in the first phase of development:

1. **Interface & Flow Integration** (Current Phase)
   - Core UI/UX interface has been implemented
   - End-to-end workflow for mock deployments is in place
   - Components are modular for easy extension

The following phases are planned but not yet implemented:

2. **Connect to TFChain** (Next Phase)
3. **Stripe Integration** (Planned)
4. **Backend Integration** (Planned)
5. **Documentation & CI** (Ongoing)
6. **Deployment** (Planned)

## Planned Backend Integration

The backend provides example code for frontend integration in `backend/examples/frontend-integration`. These examples will be adapted and implemented in the frontend codebase in future development phases.

### Planned Integration Files

The following files will handle backend integration:

- `src/services/auth.js`: Authentication service for Auth0 integration
- `src/services/api.js`: API client for making requests to the backend
- `src/services/payment.js`: Service for Stripe payment integration

## Planned Authentication

The frontend will use Auth0 for authentication in future development phases. The authentication flow will be implemented following the examples provided in the backend integration examples.

Currently, the frontend uses a mock authentication system with hardcoded credentials for demonstration purposes. The actual Auth0 integration will be implemented in the "Backend Integration" phase of development.

The planned authentication implementation will include:

1. An Auth0Provider component to manage authentication state
2. Context API for sharing authentication state across components
3. Protected routes that require authentication
4. Role-based access control for different user types (Cloud User, Cloud Provider, Cloud Operator)

## Planned API Client

An API client will be implemented in future development phases to handle communication with the backend API. It will automatically include authentication tokens in requests.

## Planned Payment Processing

Stripe integration for payment processing will be implemented in future development phases.

## Deployment

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Update `vite.config.js` with your base URL:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  base: '/tfcloud-marketplace/'
});
```

2. Add a deploy script to `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy": "npm run build && gh-pages -d dist"
}
```

3. Install gh-pages:

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages
```

4. Deploy:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Deploy to Netlify

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
3. Configure environment variables in Netlify dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Development Server Issues**
   - Ensure Node.js version 16 or later is installed

   - Check for port conflicts (default port is 3000)
   - Review terminal output for error messages

2. **Build Issues**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check for TypeScript errors
   - Verify environment variables are properly set
   - Review build logs for detailed error information

3. **UI Rendering Issues**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
