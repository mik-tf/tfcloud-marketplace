# Welcome

The ThreeFold Cloud Marketplace is built on a three-layer ecosystem to ensure a cohesive and complete circular economyâ€”by the people, for the people. Below is a three-layer vertical flow from bottom to top, illustrating how each layer builds upon the previous one:

  NO["Node Operators<br/>Provide nodes: Internet & cloud resources"]
  DO["Dashboard Operators<br/>Provide app platform for users built on the nodes"]
  DU["Dashboard Users<br/>Deploy apps on the cloud marketplace"]

  NO --> DO
  DO --> DU
```

Use the sidebar to explore each role in detail.
