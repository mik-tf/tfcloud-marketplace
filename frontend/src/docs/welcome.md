The ThreeFold Cloud Marketplace is an open, decentralized platform that unites community-driven infrastructure with streamlined application services. Cloud Providers supply the underlying compute and storage resources, Cloud Operators deploy and manage applications on that infrastructure, and Cloud Users leverage these applications to deliver workloads globally.
