# Dashboard User Documentation

**Dashboard Users** interact with the Fiat-Commercial Dashboards to deploy applications on the ThreeFold Grid.

## Role and Responsibilities

- Create an account and link a credit/debit card (no crypto knowledge required).
- Deploy applications via user-friendly dashboards using **Basic** (automatic node selection) or **Advanced** (custom filters) modes.

- Monitor deployment status and manage application configurations.

## Best Practices
